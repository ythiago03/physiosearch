Diagnosis of PFPS is primarily based on history and physical examination, but the findings on physical examination are often subtle and do not consistently correlate with symptoms described. Yoon and Fredericson published a review article in 2006 detailing the physical examination maneuvers most frequently used to assist clinicians in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of PFPS, and our aim in this review is to provide an update on this previous article focusing on the literature published over the past 15 years regarding the topic."

Current evidence does not identify alignment, muscle weakness, and patellar maltracking or a combination of these as causes of PFP. Rather than solely investigating biomechanics, we suggest a holistic approach to address the causes of PFP. Both external loads, such as changes in training parameters and biomechanics, and internal loads, such as sleep and psychological stress, should be considered. As for the management of runners with PFP, recent research suggested that various interventions can be considered to help symptoms, even if these interventions target biomechanical factors that may not have caused the injury in the first place. In this Current Concepts article, we describe how the latest evidence on education about training modifications, strengthening exercises, gait and footwear modifications, and psychosocial factors can be applied when treating runners with PFP. The importance of maintaining relative homeostasis between load and capacity will be emphasized. Recommendations for temporary or longer-term interventions will be discussed. A holistic, evidence-based approach should consist of a graded exposure to load, including movement, exercise, and running, while considering the capacity of the individual, including sleep and psychosocial factors. Cost, accessibility, and the personal preferences of patients should also be considered."

Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinician experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the patient’s values, expectations, and preferences. However, we suggest that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient’s medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made."

                content: "A ruptura do ligamento cruzado anterior (LCA) representa mais da metade de todas as lesões de joelho em esportes que envolvem rotações do corpo e mudanças repentinas de direção. Dar alta ao atleta para retorno ao jogo (RTP) após a reconstrução do LCA (ACLR) é uma tarefa difícil com responsabilidade multidisciplinar. Por muitos anos, um período de seis meses após a ACLR foi adotado como o único critério para RTP. No entanto, agora é sugerido que a RTP não deve ser exclusivamente baseada no tempo, mas em dados clínicos e avaliações sistemáticas. Apesar da importância dos fatores pós-ACLR para RTP, fatores pré e peri-ACLR também devem ser considerados. Historicamente, a ACLR é realizada com os tendões isquiotibiais ou patelares autólogos, embora a escolha do enxerto ainda seja um tema aberto e em constante evolução. A reconstrução do ligamento anterolateral e o reparo da ruptura da rampa meniscal associada à ACLR foram recentemente sugeridos como estratégias para melhorar a estabilidade da articulação do joelho. Questionários subjetivos são fáceis de aplicar e ajudam a identificar fatores físicos ou psicológicos que podem dificultar a RTP. Testes funcionais, como hop test e avaliação de força por meio de dinamômetros isocinéticos, são ferramentas fundamentais para tomada de decisão quando associados à avaliação clínica e à ressonância magnética. Recentemente, a capacidade de gerar força de forma explosiva foi incorporada à avaliação da força muscular. Isso é quantificado por meio da taxa de desenvolvimento de torque (RTD). Devido às características inerentes à prática esportiva, há um tempo extremamente curto disponível para produzir força. Assim, o RTD parece representar melhor as demandas atléticas do que a avaliação da força máxima isoladamente. Esta revisão investiga os fatores pré, peri e pós-LCA estabelecidos na literatura e compartilha nossa prática clínica, que consideramos ser a melhor prática para RTP."
